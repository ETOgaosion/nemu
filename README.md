# ICS2022 Programming Assignment

This project is the programming assignment of the class ICS (Introduction to Computer System)
in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University.

    - [x] pa2-1: decoder [8.11]
    - [x] pa2-2: infrastructure(2), all tess pass [8.25]
        - [x] advanced itrace: show register value
        - [x] mtrace
        - [x] ftrace
        - [x] diff test
    - [x] pa2-3: IOE [8.26]
        - [x] serial
        - [x] timer
        - [x] dtrace
        - [x] keyboard
        - [x] VGA
        - [x] audio
- [ ] pa3: Batch OS
    - [x] pa3-1: hardware support [8.27]
        - [x] csr registers and operations
        - [x] trap and context switch
        - [x] etrace
    - [x] pa3-2: user programs and syscalls [8.28]
        - [x] load user programs
        - [x] syscall: exit, yield, write(0/1), brk
    - [x] pa3-3: FS, VFS, devices [8.30]
        - [x] FS operations
        - [x] IOE: serial, timer, keyboard, vedio
        - [ ] TODO: other VFS directories
- [ ] pa4: TDM OS (Time-Division Multiplexing)
    - [x] pa4-1: Multiplexing [9.8]
        - [x] context switch
        - [x] kernel threads and user processes
        - [x] all tests pass

Beyond normal contents, TODOs:

- [ ] Optimization:
    - [x] rv64 program instruction analysis, adjust decoding order [+11 pts]
    - [x] refactor decode operation with hash decoder and force jump table [+10 pts]
        - this is as far as we can do, cannot be equal to 1
    - [ ] multi-launch cpu emulation, use pthread or sth. else
    - [ ] branch prediction, use AI
- [ ] Feature Requests:
    - [ ] floating points support

# NEMU Documentary

We built nemu for riscv64 architecture.

## Implementation

### pa2

#### Decode

There is RISCV-G for both 32 bits and 64 bits instruction format, but RISCV-64 has some difference operation, read RISCV-Chinese and RISCV-64I manual to check every instruction behavior like sign-extension.

#### Infrastructure

We suggest not use llvm decoder to generate itrace, but use our own decoder information instead. Though decoder infomation, we can not only get instruction details, but also can know register and memory value as we like, thus sacrifice some performance but does great for debugging.

mtrace only gather information in pread/pwrite.

ftrace is also in decode stage, we judge whether the operation is function call and ret. Riscv64 has some tricks, but due to our observation, they have these traits:

- call: jalr or jal operation, dnpc is function address base
- ret: jalr rd, rs1, [addr], [addr] is in function address scale, function depth > 0

#### Device

AM_UP_TIME bug: in `nemu/src/device/timer.c`, only when register offset is 4, nemu would update timers, but at that time, lower bits have been read, if the time goes ahead, lower bits will not be valid. So we change the offset to 0, only first time query register will modify the timers, and we can make sure the concurrency been promised.

#### Benchmarks

see [benchmarks_results](./benchmarks.md).

#### FCEUX

```C
// fceux-am/src/fceu.cpp
#define FUNC_IDX_MAX256
```

##### WSL sound

To enable WSL sound, [this](https://x410.dev/cookbook/wsl/enabling-sound-in-wsl-ubuntu-let-it-sing/) is helpful, but line 60-61 should be:

```
load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=0.0.0.0 auth-anonymous=1
load-module module-esound-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=0.0.0.0 auth-anonymous=1
```

or you can use wsl ip to promise safety.

In wsl, exportation would be:

```sh
export HOST_IP=$(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}')
export PULSE_SERVER=tcp:$HOST_IP
```

### pa3

#### ELF

Use `riscv64-unknown-elf-readelf -h xxx.elf` can read header and find Magic is always: `Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`

### pa4

#### VME

This is the **most difficult part** in the whole pa, for reasons below:

- Lack of debug tools (Infrastructures)
    - Difftests not working anymore, data in fs is wrongly set
    - Test our experience to find real reason which causes the bug
    - Log is the most sufficient tool, `mtrace` and `itrace` does a lot of help

Here are some holes (Âùë) that you can pre-read to avoid falling in:

- Notice the bit masks, set them correctly
- AM's `malloc` should be set carefully, separated from nanos' `new_page`. There is an easy way to resolve this: divide the free memory space. I've tried to mix them up, but failed, still have misunderstandable bugs.
- Things that the lecture notes not mention
    - context switch when trapping should change: **`sp` should not be the one used in user stack, but shall be set to kernel stack**. So not only `sp` needs to be used, but also **`tp` as trap pointer, pointing to a fixed context location of each process**. When user program trap in, the sp should be set to tp as context base location, and kernel tasks should execute with this kernel stack.
    - But here is a problem: We need to support nested trap, because yield could happen in M mode. So we should put `mtvec` to a new kernel trap function `__am_asm_trap_m` as long as we enter `__am_asm_trap`. As we should support nested trap, we can simply make `sp` decrease each time as original code. Current environment is at high priviledge mode, sp is on kernel stack of course.
